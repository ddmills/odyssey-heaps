# inventory system

- the inventory has a size determined by the size of the ship
- some items can "stack" a limited time (16)
- some items are consumable, and provide some benefit on consumption
- some items are passive bonus
- some items are quest items
- some items have a "trade value" and "trade cost"
    - cost is the amount it costs to purchase
    - value is how much you would get for selling it
- (?) not every settlement/NPC uses $, some use a barter system
- if your inventory size is exceeded, the ship becomes overladened (encumbered)
= if you are overladened you must get rid of something before you can move

# hunger

- hunger is a number between 0 and 100
- hunger increases every 12 turns
- if hunger reaches 100, crew member start losing loyalty
- hunger can be decreased by consuming foods
- different foods decrease hunger by different amounts
    - hard tack is cheap, and doesn't decrease hunger much
    - animals, like chickens and pigs, can decrease hunger by a lot
- foods can be purchased at settlements

# Some mechanics

- Killing some enemies will grant "tropies" rather than money
    - trophies consume inventory space
- Most basic foods will stack (hard tack, apples), but won't provide as much
    - some food will not stack (pigs)
    - some food might provide other bonuses besides reducing hunger
- In game, an "estimated food" could be determined for travel time to another settlement or location on the map
- Certain stories may take place when supplies are low
