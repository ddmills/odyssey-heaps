# Goal
Manage your crew to progressively defeat increasing levels of challenge.

As the game progresses, the difficulty should increase:
- More aggressive enemies
- increase costs?



## Discovery/Exploration
- landmarks (old trees, view, mountain, river)
- collectables
- "locked" areas (need special equipment)
- clues/storylines (journal entries?)
- Major ports
    - a few "major port" cities exist, which you can quick-travel between
    - the major port must be discovered before you can travel there
- exploration must be "dangerous"
    - enemies (duh)
    - resources
- clear goals (quests?)
    - go from a to b
