## Combat

There are a few types of combat:
1. ship-to-mob combat
2. crew-to-mob combat
3. ship-to-fort combat (?)
4. crew-to-fort combat (?)


### ship-to-ship combat

Occurs when a ship is fighting another ship. The ship have dice, and the quality depends on how well each job is done.
Mobs do damage to parts of the ship, and potentially immobilize the ship.

Ships have two parts:
1. Mast
2. Hull

Ship dice:
1. Cannon ball (damage)
2. Wood plank (repair)
3. Rope (repair/assist)
4. Sail (move)

Ship dice combos:
1. Rope + cannonball = attempt boarding
2. sail = move closer or further

Ship and mob have a "distance", which can be made further/closer with dice. Once they are together, you can board the opposing
ship, and crew-to-mob combat begins.

### crew-to-mob combat

Occurs when the crew of a ship is fighting a mob. This can happen when the ship is close range to a mob,
when boarding a ship, or fighting land mobs. Each crew member has dice, versus the mob dice.
