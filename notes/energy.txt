## energy system

- Move order in game is based on energy
- The entity with the lowest energy gets to take an action
- Performing an action (moving, using item, etc) gives the entity energy
- Repeat

In this fashion, different entities can have different "move speeds." An entity with a higher move speed will have a lower movement energy cost.

-------------

- get all entities that have energy, sort them lowest to highest

- get the zeroeth element in the list
    - if is player:
        - check for player action
        - if player action, perform
    - if other entity:
        - perform entities actions
    - else:
        - advance time by lowest energy cost

- update world
- update render
