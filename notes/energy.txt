## energy system

- Move order in game is based on energy
- Entites have -INFINITY to 0 energy
- The entity with zero energy gets to take an action
- Performing an action (moving, using item, etc) subtracts energy from the entity
- if no entity has zero energy, the game advances by that many "ticks"
- On each game "tick", every entity gains +1 energy
- Repeat

In this fashion, different entities can have different "move speeds." An entity with a higher move speed will have a lower movement energy cost.

-------------

- get all entities that have energy, sort them lowest to highest

- get the zeroeth element in the list
    - if is player:
        - check for player action
        - if player action, perform
    - if other entity:
        - perform entities actions
    - else:
        - advance time by lowest energy cost

- update world
- update render
